Entropy = 0.000000 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 10485760 byte file by 100 percent.

Chi square distribution for 10485760 samples is 2673868800.00, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 0.0000 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 4.000000000 (error 27.32 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is undefined (all values equal!).
