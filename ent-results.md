Entropy = 7.999993 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 104857600 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 104857600 samples is 981.65, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5050 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.142379957 (error 0.03 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000018 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
